# Templates

HIdP provides a set of basic templates that youâ€™ll likely want to customize
to match your application's look and feel.

These templates are located in the `templates/hidp` directory.
To override them, create a file in your application's template directory
with the same path as the templates you are trying to override.

Forms are rendered using Django's built-in form rendering system, and each
form is assigned their own template. In order to override the form templates,
using a template from your project's template directory some additional
configuration is required.

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...,
  "django.forms",
  ...,
]

FORM_RENDERER = "django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting"
```

For more information on overriding templates in general, visit
[Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/overriding-templates/).

For more information on overriding form templates, read this section in
[Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/forms/#reusable-form-templates).

## Base templates

To facilitate the common use case of having a distinct layout for the pre-login and
post-login pages, HIdP provides a base template hierarchy that you can extend to
customize the layout of your application.

### base.html

This is the root base template that every template in HIdP extends. It includes the
basic HTML boilerplate for each page. Override this template to load custom CSS,
scripts, and set up a base layout.

This template defines two blocks that all other templates depend on:

`title`
: inside the HTML `title` tag.

`body`
: inside the HTML `body` tag.

`main`
: inside the `body` block, where the main application content is rendered.

This template also defines two blocks that you can extend to inject extra styles and/or
scripts:

`extra_head`
: inside the HTML head tag, after the `title` tag.

`extra_body`
: inside the HTML body tag, below the `body` block.

### base_pre_login.html

This template extends `base.html` and is used for all pre-login pages. It does not
add anything over the base template and is only provided as an extension point.

### base_post_login.html

This template extends `base.html` and is used for all post-login pages. It does not
add anything over the base template and is only provided as an extension point.

### base_form.html

This is the base template for all forms in HIdP. It extends the default Django form
template (`django/forms/div.html`) (without any modifications). Override this template
to customize the layout of HIdP forms on a global basis.

Each form is assigned a template that extends this base template (again, without any
modifications). These templates are noted in the per-page documentation below.
