# Templates

HIdP provides a set of basic templates that youâ€™ll likely want to customize
to match your application's look and feel.

These templates are located in the `templates/hidp` directory.
To override them, create a file in your application's template directory
with the same path as the templates you are trying to override.

For more information on overriding templates, visit
[Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/overriding-templates/).

The templates available are:
