# Templates

HIdP provides a set of basic templates that youâ€™ll likely want to customize
to match your application's look and feel.

These templates are located in the `templates/hidp` directory.
To override them, create a file in your application's template directory
with the same path as the templates you are trying to override.

For more information on overriding templates, visit
[Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/overriding-templates/).

The templates available are:
:::{contents}
:depth: 5
:local:
:::

## base.html

This is the base template that every template in HIdP extends. It includes the basic
HTML boilerplate for each page. Override this template to load custom CSS, scripts,
and set up a base layout.

This template defines two blocks that all other templates depend on:
- `title` - inside the HTML title tag.
- `body` - inside the HTML body tag.

This template also defines two blocks that you can extend to inject extra styles and/or
scripts:
- `extra_head` - inside the HTML head tag, after the `title` tag.
- `extra_body` - inside the HTML body tag, below the `body` block.
