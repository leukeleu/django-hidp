# Security Policy

In case you have found a security issue within ANY HIdP project please do NOT open public GitHub issues, pull requests or anything that could leak sensitive information to the public.

Leukeleu asks you to instead responsibly report the security issue by email to security@leukeleu.nl.

Your email is sent to the security team of Leukeleu. A member of the organization will respond to you acknowledging your initial email and then, depending on the action to be taken, further follow-up emails afterwards.

## Scope of this policy

This policy applies to all HIdP projects hosted under the GitHub organization [Leukeleu](`github.com/leukeleu`).

## Supported Versions

We currently support the following versions of HIdP projects with security updates:
- Latest stable release
- Previous stable release

## Response Time

Leukeleu aims to respond to security reports within 5 business days. Resolution times may vary depending on the complexity of the issue.

## Third-Party Dependencies

If the security issue is related to a third-party dependency, we recommend reporting the issue directly to the respective maintainers. Leukeleu will assist in updating the dependency once a fix is available.
