# Security Policy

In case you have found a security issue within ANY HIdP project please do NOT open public GitHub issues, pull requests or anything that could leak sensitive information to the public.

Leukeleu asks you to instead responsibly report the security issue by email to security@leukeleu.nl.

Your email is sent to the security team of Leukeleu. A member of the organization will respond to you acknowledging your initial email and then, depending on the action to be taken, further followup emails afterwards.
